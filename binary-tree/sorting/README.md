# Binary Tree Sorting in JavaScript

Sorting data using binary trees is an efficient and intuitive way to organize elements. This guide covers common methods for binary tree sorting in JavaScript.

## Types of Binary Tree Sorting

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Sort**:
   - Insert all elements into a Binary Search Tree (BST).
   - Perform an in-order traversal to retrieve elements in sorted order.
   - Time complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case if the tree becomes unbalanced.

2. **Heap Sort**:
   - Utilizes a binary heap (a complete binary tree).
   - Build a max heap (or min heap) and repeatedly extract the maximum (or minimum) element to sort the array.
   - Time complexity: O(n log n).

3. **AVL Tree Sort**:
   - Uses an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
   - Insert elements into the AVL tree and perform an in-order traversal for sorted order.
   - Guarantees O(n log n) time complexity for both insertion and in-order traversal.

4. **Red-Black Tree Sort**:
   - Utilizes a red-black tree, another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
   - Insert elements into the red-black tree and perform an in-order traversal for sorted order.
   - Guarantees O(n log n) time complexity for both insertion and in-order traversal.
