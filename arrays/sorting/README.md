# Arrays Sorting
In JavaScript, arrays can be sorted using various sorting algorithms. Some common types of sorting algorithms for JavaScript arrays include:

## Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Selection Sort
Another comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

## Insertion Sort
A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input list, removing one element from the input data, finding its correct position in the sorted list, and inserting it there.

## Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides the input list into smaller sublists, sorts the sublists, and then merges them back together to produce the sorted output.

## Quick Sort
Another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the input list into two sublists
elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists.

## Heap Sort
A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort the input list. It builds a max heap from the input data and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap to produce the sorted output.

## Radix Sort
A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts the input list by first grouping the elements by individual digits or significant positions, then sorting the elements according to their radix (base).
